            <h3>CAREER...</h3>
            <div class="career">
                <p>N.R. Narayana Murthy, the founder of Infosys and a Padma Vibhushan recipient, is one of the world's most influential people. He is also known as the "Father of the Indian Information Technology Sector."

                    He is a well-known billionaire Indian businessman, admired entrepreneur, self-made success, and role model for younger generations. Murthy also authored the uplifting book Better India: A Better World. He lays out the ground rules that must be followed in order for future generations to inherit a truly progressive country in his book.
                    
                    Here are a few inspirational quotes from Infosys founder Narayana Murthy.
                    
                    “You do not have to be the son of a rich man to be an entrepreneur. Today kids are far more willing to take risks because they’ve seen high rewards.”
                    “Organisations with decision-making speed and imagination will thrive as nobody can claim to have a monopoly over creativity.”

“Learning from experience, however, can be complicated. It can be much more difficult to learn from success than from failure. If we fail, we think carefully about the precise cause. Success can indiscriminately reinforce all our prior actions.”

“It is less important where you start. It is more important how and what you learn. If the quality of the learning is high, the development gradient is steep, and, given time, you can find yourself in a previously unattainable place.”

“Leadership is about doing the right thing, even if it is going against a vast number of naysayers and mediocre people.”

“The biggest impediment to growth is in our minds and not in the world outside, and the only constant in the world is change.”
